Project Title : Deploying a web application on aws using kubernetes and jenkins CI/CD pipeline with monitoring

Description : 
We are deploying a web application on AWS using CI/CD pipeline. Utilizing Git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, Jenkins Pipeline for automation, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for container orchestration, the project ensures streamlined development. The pipeline integrates continuous integration with tools like maven for build, SonarQube for code quality analysis, OWASP ZAP for dynamic application security testing, and Trivy for container vulnerability scanning while addressing security concerns. Additionally, continuous monitoring provides real-time insights into application health and performance using Terraform and Grafana
